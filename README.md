In this repo.

This repo is a example of how we can get the phone number from any website. 
if you paste the html code into header it will work in all pages unless user will fill the form after filling the form number pop up wil be disappeared and it won't show again if the same ip address
It working as if the number is different and ip address is different so the pop up will appear and if same it won't show.
after filling the number phone number will be inserted into the table and you can get the data and show it to admin area 

It will work for those platform who doesn't have backend (shopify).
I have tested this in shopify
